Python has been extended to do the same type operations with numpy, which allows matrix-like arrays so it can compete with matlab. Scipy builds on top of numpy by providing signal processing algorithms like FFTs that make analyzing sleep data possible. Pandas is also built on top of numpy to allow you to treat data sets like a database table and do statistical analyses with reasonable treatment of missing data. You could do all of these things on your own with python, but it's nice somebody else spent their time to write all of the code for us."
